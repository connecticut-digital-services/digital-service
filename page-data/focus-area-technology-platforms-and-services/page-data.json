We must invest in paying down our “IT debt” to build new technology around the edges of the old and phase out systems that have outlived their usefulness. With the right teams in place, we can empower them to effectively make change in their agencies by offering tools, standards, and platforms to collaborate, iterate, and improve.</p>\n<p>Below are considerations we have in mind as we adapt IT systems and/or products to work more efficiently in service to the public:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use each project as a learning experience and document lessons learned</li>\n<li>Share these lessons with others (internally and externally)</li>\n<li>Establish policies, standards, and tools that provide the public access to more and more open datasets</li>\n<li>Identify aging systems before entering crisis</li>\n<li>Establish a strategy (e.g., “encapsulation method”) for replacing legacy systems</li>\n<li>Use times of technological transition to modernize the IT stack, structure, end points, and even the purpose of the system</li>\n<li>Develop standards to govern the migration from legacy platforms— standards that guide iterative replacement of functionality, interoperability with other systems, continuous evolution to meet changing needs, and building on a modern tech stack</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are an agency or department looking to better understand this, we can help. </p>\n<h2>Key Actions &#x26; Timelines</h2>\n<p>Below are specific actions and timelines we will complete to ensure technology platforms and services are working efficiently and meeting the needs of our users. </p>\n<h2>Key Actions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Develop centralized tools and architecture</li>\n<li>Optimize digital service delivery</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Timelines</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"Technology Platforms and Services","icon":"phone-laptop","cta":"Learn more about our efforts and specific examples of our work.","cta_link":"/work","items":[{"title":"0-6 months","description":"* Build conceptual architecture for delivering digital services\n* Build a digital services blueprint to define user groups and shared digital touch points"},{"title":"6-12 months","description":"* Finalize digital architecture\n* Configure new platforms and tools"},{"title":"12-18+ months","description":"Establish new service support models, revise SLAs"}]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"0e9cec9a-1ec6-53fa-b8ae-da352d2670a2","slug":"/focus-area-technology-platforms-and-services/"}}}
