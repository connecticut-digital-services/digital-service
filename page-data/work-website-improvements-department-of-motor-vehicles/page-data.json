Users had trouble finding the information they needed. In addition, there were certain changes the DMV needed to make in its digital services as part of the REAL ID Act, federal legislation establishing minimum security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards. The DMV reached out for help and we answered the call. </p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Through talking with users and reviewing website traffic patterns, we found redundant and confusing processes for important tasks people came to the website to complete such as renewing a car registration. We identified the three main reasons visitors come to the DMV’s website and made small and focused changes to improve the DMV’s landing page, and streamline the online registration and license processes. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/screen-shot-2019-12-12-at-9.21.27-am.png\" alt=\"DMV site improvements\" title=\"DMV site improvements\"></p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>By addressing vital user needs and improving the overall customer experience, the total amount of negative feedback has already decreased by over 20 percent in the three weeks since the changes were made.
