Government has been notorious for providing frustrating customer experiences. We want to start changing that. By transforming constituents’ interactions with us into accessible, useful, and even delightful digital experiences, we can restore their confidence in government and their willingness to engage. Our end goal is exceptional customer service.

Here is a list of critical questions to ask ourselves as agencies working toward putting users first:  

* Do we understand the needs and contexts of our users? 
* What pain points, what challenges exist in everyday interactions with government?
* What service delivery changes can we make to improve those interactions?
* Are we creating and following uniform standards for user experience (e.g. content and style guides)?
* Are we addressing the user’s whole experience, from start to finish?
* Are we delivering a unified experience by bridging gaps between organizational silos seamlessly and behind the scenes?
* Are we helping to cultivate clear two-way communication between government and constituents?
* Are we providing a consistent, high quality experience? How do we know?
