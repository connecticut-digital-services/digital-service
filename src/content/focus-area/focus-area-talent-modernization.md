A key to digital transformation is cultivating a digitally mature workforce. This requires building capacity and equipping our existing workforce with the tools and resources they need to navigate challenges and deliver user-centered services. This also means bringing in new talent  from outside government.  

Here are some straightforward practices we’re embracing to grow capacity and skills on the inside and recruit top digital talent to support the state:   

* Identify skills missing from existing teams
* Arm existing teams with the tools and resources they need to learn new skills and adopt modern standards
* Provide opportunities for career growth and professional development
* Cultivate networks of practice to develop and share ideas and best practices
* Attract high quality, diverse talent
* Quickly onboard and integrate new team members
* Cultivate an environment of collaboration and learning
* Establish and empower cross-functional delivery teams
* Provide teams the autonomy to develop internally consistent processes and values
* Develop a reputation for being a collaborative, supportive, and inclusive place to work
