No government agency can escape the Information Technology (IT) systems that were put into place years — maybe even generations — ago that no longer meet our needs. We must invest in paying down our “IT debt” to build new technology around the edges of the old and phase out systems that have outlived their usefulness. With the right teams in place, we can empower them to effectively make change in their agencies by offering tools, standards, and platforms to collaborate, iterate, and improve.

Below are considerations we have in mind as we adapt IT systems and/or products to work more efficiently in service to the public:  

* Use each project as a learning experience and document lessons learned
* Share these lessons with others (internally and externally)
* Establish policies, standards, and tools that provide the public access to more and more open datasets
* Identify aging systems before entering crisis
* Establish a strategy (e.g., “encapsulation method”) for replacing legacy systems
* Use times of technological transition to modernize the IT stack, structure, end points, and even the purpose of the system
* Develop standards to govern the migration from legacy platforms— standards that guide iterative replacement of functionality, interoperability with other systems, continuous evolution to meet changing needs, and building on a modern tech stack

If you are an agency or department looking to better understand this, we can help.
